Especially\nwhen that someone is myself.  It's an educational retreat for programmers, there\nare no teachers, and everyone is working on whatever they feel like working on.</p>\n<p>One thing I'm getting used to is developing an intuition for how much effort to\nput into any given task, for how long, and with what intensity.  What I've\nfound, perhaps obviously, is to do whatever you feel like, whenever you feel\nlike, and to quit right when it gets boring.  It's a rare privilege to be able\nto drop everything for three months and pursue whatever interests you.
